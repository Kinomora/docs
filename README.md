# Introduction

## Welcome to the Sia Docs!

Welcome to the Sia Docs, your gateway to the remarkable world of decentralized cloud storage. Whether you're a tech-savvy enthusiast or are exploring the potential of decentralized cloud storage for enhancing data security, you've come to the right place.

Our documentation provides comprehensive information for anyone interested in decentralized cloud storage.

The information in these docs has been compiled from several sources, primarily the previous Sia Support Center and community-driven sites like the now-deprecated [Sia Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921135627/https://siawiki.tech/index) and [SiaStats](https://siastats.info), as well as current repositories of data like [SiaSetup](https://siasetup.info) and the [API Docs](https://api.sia.tech).

## Submitting your edits

Keeping our documentation current is a substantial undertaking, and with GitBook, we've opened the door for community members to actively contribute their ideas. Whether you want to suggest edits to existing content or create entirely new articles, you can do so.
