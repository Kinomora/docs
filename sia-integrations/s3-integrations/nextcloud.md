# Nextcloud

## What is Nextcloud?

Nextcloud is an open-source content collaboration platform. Itâ€™s like your own Cloud service that runs on your own hardware. You can use it for storing and sharing files through a web interface, mobile app, or desktop client, and even to collaborate with others or as a communication platform. There is almost no limit to what it can do with its open plugin store.

## Step 1: Install `renterd` and configure S3
This guide requires a working installation of `renterd`. If you have not already installed `renterd`, you will need to do so before continuing.

## All done.

We successfully used `renterd` and rclone to mount our Sia storage as a filesystem. This is a great way to use Sia for your files, especially for use cases such as large video or media libraries that take up many terabytes of space but you would still like available for streaming at any moment. If this guide has been engaging, check out our website to read more about Sia and `renterd`, and join our Discord, where the team and community can answer your questions!
