# Brand Guidelines

Third-party projects constitute an integral part of the Sia ecosystem as they broaden the range of applications of Sia and enhance the network through solutions that are not actively being developed by our team.

We aim for users to discern between core and non-core projects for several reasons:

* Non-core projects often involve some level of centralization, which is entirely acceptable. Users benefit from having choices, and centralization allows for the implementation of features that are more accessible to achieve compared to those on Sia's core infrastructure.
* There's a potential for confusion where users might mistake your project for something created by the core team. Therefore, we want to ensure that users know where to seek assistance.
* Acknowledge your dedication to your project; we desire to give it the recognition it deserves, allowing it to stand out prominently.

## Guidelines

These Sia brand guidelines will assist those developing their project by ensuring clarity, consistency, and distinction between other projects and core Sia offerings, ultimately fostering user trust and recognition.

### Logo and Wordmark

The Sia Foundation strictly owns the trademark in the US and advises against using the Sia logo and wordmark directly in any capacity, such as projects. Users can only style the original logo and wordmark to prevent confusion and misrepresentation.

<div data-full-width="false">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sia_original.png" alt="" width="300"><figcaption><p>Original Sia Logo and wordmark</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/siastats.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Example of styling of the original (Siastats logo)</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The logo can be similar but **must** be differentiated from the original Sia logo and wordmark by color and design.
{% endhint %}

### Naming

Sia's trademark name is pronounced _"sigh-uh,_ not _"see-ya."_

Using the term **Sia** is accepted naming your in your project; however, there are two restrictions:

* Do not call your project solely **Sia**.
* You may use the term Sia in your project, but do not append a term directly related to our business, such as **Cloud**, **Storage**, or **Backup,** or add a term that we already use like **renterd, hostd,** or **walletd.** The final name must be substantially different from current Foundation offerings.

Some examples of this include **SiaStats**, **Siasync**, **SiaWiki**, and **Siamining**. These names provide a clear indication that the focus is on Sia while not treading into "The Foundation already makes that" territory.

You also have the option to craft a uniquely personalized name that reflects your identity or your creative efforts. Illustrative instances of such custom names include **Pixeldrain**, **Filebase**, and **Roadie**.
